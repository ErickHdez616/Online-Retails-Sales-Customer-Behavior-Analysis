## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Understand overall revenue performance
- Identify sales trends and seasonality
- Determine top revenue-generating products
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior
- Evaluate geographic market performance
- Support data-driven decisions on pricing, inventory, and customer retention

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data inspection, cleaning, calculated fields, pivot analysis
- **SQL** – Data storage, aggregation, and business queries
- **Python** – Exploratory data analysis and validation
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and business storytelling

## 📂 Dataset Description
<p align="justify">Dataset: Online Retail Dataset </p>
<p align="justify">Data Type: Transaction-level e-commerce sales data </p>
<p align="justify">Key Columns </p>

- InvoiceNo
- StockCode
- Description
- Quantity
- InvoiceDate
- UnitPrice
- CustomerID
- Country
<p align="justify">The dataset represents what was sold, when it was sold, to whom, in what quantity, at what price, and from which country.</p>

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)
<p align="justify">Excel was used as the first analysis tool, reflecting real-world business workflows.</p>
<p align="justify">Key Cleaning Steps</p>

- Removed blank rows and duplicate records
- Handled missing CustomerID values by creating a Customer Type column instead of deleting valid transactions
- Identified zero-price transactions (e.g., free samples, promotions, test records)
- Flagged zero-price records using a Price Status column rather than manipulating values
<p align="justify">Calculated Fields Created</p>

- Total Sales (Revenue) = Quantity × UnitPrice
- Invoice Month – Enables trend analysis
- Year – Supports yearly comparison
<p align="justify">This approach ensured data integrity while preserving valuable transactional records.</p>

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (Excel)
<p align="justify">Pivot tables were used to quickly explore patterns and validate assumptions.</p>
<p align="justify">Key Insights</p>

- Total Revenue: 11,585,621.15
- Monthly Sales Trend: Clear peaks indicating seasonality and promotional periods
- Top-Selling Product: Paper Craft, Little Birdie
- Quantity vs Revenue: High sales volume does not always equal high revenue
- Geographic Performance: United Kingdom dominates total sales revenue

## 🐍 Python Analysis
<p align="justify">Python was used to perform deeper EDA and validation of insights discovered in Excel.</p>
<p align="justify">Key Tasks</p>

- Verified data types and missing values
- Filtered normal transactions to ensure revenue accuracy
- Confirmed total revenue figures
- Analyzed:
- Monthly sales trends
- Product performance
- Purchase frequency patterns
<p align="justify">Python ensured analytical accuracy and scalability beyond spreadsheet limitations.</p>
